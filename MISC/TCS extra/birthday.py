# Tom is planning to celebrate the birthday of his friend, Diksha. There are two types of gifts that Diksha wants from Tom: one is black and the other is white. To make her happy, Tom has to buy b black gifts and w white gifts.

# The cost of each black gift is bc units.
# The cost of every white gift is wc units.
# The cost of converting each black gift into a white gift or vice versa is z units.
# Help Tom by deducing the minimum amount he needs to spend on Dikshaâ€™s gifts.

# Function Description

# tomBday has the following parameter(s):

# b: the number of black gifts
# w: the number of white gifts
# bc: the cost of a black gift
# wc: the cost of a white gift
# z: the cost to convert one color gift to the other color
# Input Format
# The first line will contain an integer t, the number of test cases.
# The next t pairs of lines are as follows:

# The first line contains the values of integers b and w.
# The next line contains the values of integers bc, wc, and z.
# Output Format
# t lines, each containing an integer: the minimum amount of units Tom needs to spend on gifts.
