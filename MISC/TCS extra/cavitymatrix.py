# You are given a square map as a matrix of integer strings. Each cell of the map has a value denoting its depth. We will call a cell of the map a cavity if and only if this cell is not on the border of the map and each cell adjacent to it has strictly smaller depth. Two cells are adjacent if they have a common side or edge. Find all the cavities on the map and replace their depths with the uppercase character X.

# For example, given a matrix:
# 989
# 191
# 111
# You should return:
# 989
# 1X1
# 111

# The center cell was deeper than those on its edges: [8,1,1,1]. The deep cells in the top two corners donâ€™t share an edge with the center cell.
# Function Description
# It should return an array of strings, each representing a line of the completed map.
# function takes the following parameter(s):

# grid: an array of strings, each representing a row of the grid
# Input Format
# The first line contains an integer n, the number of rows and columns in the map.
# Each of the following n lines (rows) contains n positive digits without spaces (columns) representing depth at map[row, column].
# Output Format
# Output n lines, denoting the resulting map. Each cavity should be replaced with the character X.
# Sample Input
# 4
# 1112
# 1912
# 1892
# 1234
# Sample Output
# 1112
# 1X12
# 18X2
# 1234
