# Williamson is an analyst he needs to analyse a particular topic for performing analysis for that he needs to find a permutation of a given object.He don’t know how to find permutation so for simplifying his work he is hiring one software developer who can code for him and find a permutation and combination of a given object.

# Consider you are giving an interview to williamson for working with him. Find a permutation of given input to proof that you are fit for his requirement.

# Input Specification:
# nCr where n and r are numbers given by Williamson to you
# nCr is defined as n! / (r! x(n-r)!)

# Here, n! denotes the factorial of a number. Also, you have to calculate this number as modulo
# Input Specification:

# input1: The number n.
# Input2: The number r.
# Input3: The number m,
# .
# Output specification:

# The value of nCr % m.
# Example 1:
# Input1: 3
# Input2: 2
# Input3: 10000000009

# Output: 3

# Explanation:
# n = 3.r = 2, m = 100 So, n != 3 != 6, r != 2 != 2, (n-1) != 1 != 1.
# So, nCr = (6/(2*1)) % 1000000009 = 3.

# Example 2:
# input1: 5
# input2: 2
# input3: 1000000009

# Output: 10

# Explanation:
# n = 5, r = 2, m = 100 So, n != 5 != 120, r != 2 = 2, (n-1) != 3 != 6.
# So, nCr = (120/(2*6)) % 1000000009 = 10.
