You are given an array A of size N.  Initially all the elements of the array are zero.

Also, you have an infinite length array S which holds the property that the index is equal to the value of the array i.e for each i(i >= 1), S[i] = i.

Now, you have Q queries to perform on array A. Each query contains two variables L and R.

For each query you have to perform the following operation:

For all index i, where L <= i <= R you have to add the value of the array S from the starting position incrementing its positions to the array element at index i, i.e

initialize j = 1

for each i = L to R:

A[i] = A[i] + S[j]

j = j+1

After performing Q queries, you need to output the final values present in array A.

Tomorrow is Kerry’s birthday. Jim is planning to gift her a rooted tree with n nodes. Nodes are numbered from 1 to n, rooted at node 1. Every node has a cost associated with it and a color either black or white. It’s been years and Jim know exactly what combination of colors Kerry will love. So, he knows which target color(Black/White) every node should have at the end.

To do so, he can perform the following operation any number of times:

Select any node p except a leaf node, and swap colors of any two nodes in the subtree of node p. This operation costs equal to the cost associated with the node p.
He wants that after performing such operations every node finally has the color corresponding to its target.

Help him find out the minimum total cost for such operations after which every node has the corresponding target color, or find out if that is impossible.
