# # Shovon is an HR in a renowned company and he is assigning people to work. Now he is assigning people work in a fashion where if he assigns somework a work of cost 2, the next person will be strictly getting a job with cost equal or more than 2. Given that Shovonâ€™s company has infinite work and a number of digitoyees, how many distributions can be possible. The cost of jobs can go 0 to 9.
# N	    Integer	            The number of depts.
# arr[]	Integer array	The number of  digitoyees in each dept..
# Return: The function must return an INTEGER denoting the sum of answers for all distinct distributions
